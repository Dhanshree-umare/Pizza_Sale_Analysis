# Pizza_Sale_Analysis
# Introduction
Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. They've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping we can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.
